# a primer on how to look for things around the house

It is very common, in life, to lose track of objects around the house. At any
time you reach out expecting a certain object to be there, there is a
probability that the object is somewhere else. In these moments, knowing how to
look for things can save you a great deal of trouble.

## preparing to go look for things

In the moment where you have determined that something is missing, these are
the steps you should take to get ready to go looking:

1. Stop
2. Breathe
3. Do not get frustrated, do not waste time complaining.
4. Discard your preconceptions. Specifically, discard your notions of where the
   object "ought" to be; you have already determined that the object is, in
   fact, not where it ought to be.
5. Make sure you know what it is that you are looking for. Think about the
   general size, the shape, the distinguishing features, the word or phrase you
   would use to name or describe it.
6. Take a moment to think about how much time you have to go looking for the
   object, and set that against how soon you need to have the object. It may be
   the case that you should time-limit your initial search.
7. Make whatever preparations you will need in order to track where you have
   searched. If you believe that you will not be able to just remember what
   sections of the house you have already looked in (e.g. if you will need to
   suspend your search), you should prepare to take notes.

## divide and sort

To begin your search:
* Take some time to consider the house (or whatever area you are searching in)
  as being divided up into regions.
* Sort those regions in order likelihood - recall where you have seen it last,
  recall your movements the last time you remember having, consider where
  someone else might have moved it.
* If you cannot think of another region where it might be more likely to be,
  default to using the region where you initially expected the object to be.
* You do not need to consider every single region of the house up front -
  picking the most likely two or three areas initially should be sufficient.
* You will, however, need to keep track of what regions you have searched as
  you go on - when you revisit this phase of considering where an object could
  be, you should exclude any that you have already properly searched.
* Outside of this phase of actually thinking about what regions of the house
  your object could be in, you should not spend time trying to think about
  where it could be.

## searching a region

Searching a region properly will require you to first subdivide the region, and
then search each of those subdivisions. Above all else, searching a region
properly requires you to actively observe everything within the region.

### subdividing a region

Any region in a house will have a number of places where object could be
present:
* surfaces
* cabinets
* drawers
* shelves
* the interiors of appliances
* places hidden by furniture or appliances
* closets (these should be treated as separate regions, but you should make
  sure to identify all the closets and pantries in your region, and add them to
  your list of places to search next)

Depending on the size and shape of the object, you may find that some of these
are implausible. You should avoid dismissing any of them too easily, though -
your memory of the size of a cabinet can easily be wrong, for example. Unless
you can be absolutely sure that your object would not fit in some section of
the current region, be prepared to search that section.

### searching sections

As you go through the region, you will need to keep track of which sections
(surfaces, drawers, cabinets, etc) you have already searched. You should also
prefer to order your search by starting at one edge of the region, and move to
an adjacent section as you complete each section.

When searching a section, you will need to look at every object present. You
should be willing to undertake all of these guidlines to ensure a thorough search:
* Start at one side or corner of the section.
* Point at an object. Ask yourself:
    * What is this object I am pointing at?
    * Is this object the one I am looking for?
* Make sure that you actually have the answers to both questions before moving
  on. You definitely do not want to answer the second question with "yes", and
  then fail to stop the search!
* Move to a nearby item and do the same.
* Do not assume that you can see all the items in the section at once. For example:
    * On a table, objects can easily be hidden behind other objects - be
      prepared to move both yourself and the objects around to ensure that you
      have seen everything on the surface.
    * In a cabinet, items may be hidden behind or underneath stacks of other
      objects. Do not assume that you have searched the full depth, actually
      search the full depth.
* Again: make sure you examine each object.

## key takeaways

Following these steps will greatly improve your ability to search for things.
The key principles to keep in mind are:
* Keep track of where you have searched
* Divide and conquer
* Be thorough, do not make any assumptions about what you can see
* Stay calm, stay focused
* Most importantly: actually examine each section and each object, and
  consciously determine whether the object is what you are looking for.
